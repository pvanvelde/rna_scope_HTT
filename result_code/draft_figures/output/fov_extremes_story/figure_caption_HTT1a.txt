FIGURE: FOV-Level Variance and Extreme Outliers - HTT1a
================================================================================

OVERVIEW:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This figure presents a comprehensive analysis of field-of-view (FOV) level variance
in clustered mRNA per cell for HTT1a transcripts. The analysis reveals
substantial inter-FOV variability in Q111 transgenic mice and identifies 'extreme'
FOVs - those exceeding the 95th percentile of wildtype distributions.

The figure tells a story in four parts:
  1. Overall distributions showing Q111 vs WT variance
  2. Temporal patterns - age-dependent accumulation of extreme FOVs
  3. Individual variation - which mice drive the extreme phenotype
  4. Spatial patterns - regional distribution along the A-P axis

DATASET STATISTICS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cortex: 697 Q111 FOVs, 134 WT FOVs
Striatum: 637 Q111 FOVs, 149 WT FOVs

Excluded slides (technical failures): m1a2, m1b5

PANEL DESCRIPTIONS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(A-B) OVERALL DISTRIBUTIONS:
Probability density histograms showing the full distribution of clustered mRNA per
cell. Q111 data is split into 'normal' (≤WT P95) and 'extreme' (>WT P95) populations.
The hatched red region represents the Q111 'tail' - FOVs with abnormally high
clustered mRNA that exceed 95% of wildtype values. (A) Cortex, (B) Striatum.

Cortex: WT P95 threshold = 12.9 mRNA/cell
  Q111: 215/697 FOVs extreme (30.8%)
  Q111 median=7.5, IQR=10.5
  WT median=7.5, IQR=6.0
  Mann-Whitney U p=8.64e-04
Striatum: WT P95 threshold = 7.8 mRNA/cell
  Q111: 399/637 FOVs extreme (62.6%)
  Q111 median=11.9, IQR=25.2
  WT median=3.7, IQR=3.9
  Mann-Whitney U p=4.75e-31

(C-D) BREAKDOWN BY AGE:
Stacked bar charts showing the number of normal vs extreme FOVs at each age (2, 6,
12 months). Percentages indicate the fraction of FOVs that are extreme at each age.
This reveals temporal patterns in the extreme phenotype. (C) Cortex, (D) Striatum.

(E-F) BREAKDOWN BY MOUSE:
Horizontal bar charts showing the top 8 mice ranked by percentage of extreme FOVs.
Each bar shows the mouse ID, slide identifier, and age in months. This reveals
inter-individual variability and identifies specific mice that drive the extreme
phenotype. (E) Cortex, (F) Striatum.

(G-H) BREAKDOWN BY ATLAS COORDINATE:
Bar charts showing the number of extreme FOVs at each brain atlas coordinate (A-P
position from Bregma in 25μm units). Color intensity reflects the fraction of FOVs
that are extreme at each coordinate (red=high, green=low). This reveals spatial
patterns along the anterior-posterior axis. (G) Cortex, (H) Striatum.

COLOR SCHEME:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sea Green (#2E8B57): Q111 normal FOVs (≤WT P95)
Dark Red (#8B0000): Q111 extreme FOVs (>WT P95)
Coral (#FF7F50): Wildtype
RdYlGn colormap: Fraction extreme (red=high, green=low)

KEY OBSERVATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Distribution variance:
   - Q111 shows substantially greater variance than wildtype
   - Clear rightward shift with extended tail beyond WT P95
   - HTT1a represents aberrant intron-1 terminated transcripts

2. Extreme FOV prevalence:
   - Significant fraction of Q111 FOVs exceed wildtype P95
   - Indicates mosaic/heterogeneous phenotype at tissue level
   - Not all cells/regions equally affected

3. Biological significance:
   - HTT1a encodes toxic N-terminal fragment with polyQ expansion
   - Extreme FOVs may represent hotspots of pathology
   - Clustering suggests sites of active transcription or aggregation

METHODOLOGY:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clustered mRNA per Cell calculation:
  - Cluster detection: DBSCAN algorithm (eps=0.75 µm, min_samples=3)
  - Intensity threshold: 2.5 × slide-specific peak intensity
  - Peak intensity: mode of KDE-fitted single spot intensity distribution
  - Clustered mRNA = Total cluster intensity / Peak intensity
  - Per-cell normalization: Clustered mRNA / N_nuclei in FOV

Extreme FOV definition:
  - Threshold = 95th percentile of Wildtype distribution (region-specific)
  - FOVs with Clustered mRNA/Cell > WT P95 classified as 'extreme'
  - This identifies Q111 FOVs in the tail of the distribution

Statistical tests:
  - Mann-Whitney U test: non-parametric comparison of medians
  - Tests whether Q111 and WT come from same distribution

Quality control:
  - Slides m1a2 and m1b5 excluded (technical failures)
  - Based on UBC positive control analysis

INTERPRETATION GUIDE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 'extreme FOV' analysis provides insight into the mosaic nature of the Q111
phenotype. Rather than a uniform elevation across all FOVs, we see a subset of
FOVs with dramatically elevated clustered mRNA. The breakdown by age, mouse, and
atlas coordinate helps identify:

  - Temporal dynamics: Does the extreme phenotype progress with age?
  - Individual variation: Are certain mice predisposed to extreme FOVs?
  - Spatial patterns: Are specific anatomical regions more affected?

This information is crucial for understanding whether the clustered mRNA phenotype
is driven by systemic factors (affecting all mice equally) or by stochastic/local
factors (creating mosaic patterns).
