SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURE: Correlation between Negative Control Threshold and Single mRNA Peak Intensity
====================================================================================================

OVERVIEW
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This figure demonstrates the strong positive correlation between the negative control threshold
(95th percentile of background intensity) and the single mRNA peak intensity (mode of spot
intensity distribution from experimental data). This correlation justifies the use of per-slide
calibration: imaging conditions that affect background also affect signal intensity.

====================================================================================================
DATA SUMMARY
====================================================================================================

Total slide-channel combinations: 30
  - HTT1a (green, 488 nm): 15 slides
  - Full-length mHTT (orange, 548 nm): 15 slides

Imaging sessions: 3
  - Session 1: 6 slide-channel combinations
  - Session 2: 12 slide-channel combinations
  - Session 3: 12 slide-channel combinations

QUALITY CONTROL:
  - Excluded slides (n=14): m1a1, m1a2, m1b2, m1b3, m1b4, m1b5, m2a1, m2a7, m2b2, m2b4, m2b5, m2b5, m3b4, m3b5
  - Reason: Poor UBC positive control expression indicating technical failures

====================================================================================================
CORRELATION ANALYSIS
====================================================================================================

Overall correlation: r = 0.9982, p = 9.21e-36

Per-channel correlations:
  - HTT1a (green): r = 0.9977, p = 1.35e-16
  - Full-length mHTT (orange): r = 0.9961, p = 4.52e-15

====================================================================================================
INTERPRETATION
====================================================================================================

The strong positive correlation (r > 0.75) between threshold and peak intensity indicates that:

1. IMAGING CONDITIONS AFFECT BOTH METRICS:
   - Higher laser power, detector gain, or tissue autofluorescence increases both
     background (threshold) and signal (peak intensity)
   - This covariation is expected from the physics of fluorescence microscopy

2. PER-SLIDE CALIBRATION CAPTURES THIS RELATIONSHIP:
   - Using slide-specific thresholds naturally accounts for imaging variability
   - The ratio (peak_intensity / threshold) is more stable than either value alone

3. IMPLICATIONS FOR mRNA QUANTIFICATION:
   - Total mRNA = N_spots + (I_clusters / I_peak)
   - Both the threshold (which spots pass) and peak (normalization factor) scale together
   - Per-slide calibration ensures consistent mRNA estimates across imaging conditions

PANEL DESCRIPTIONS
====================================================================================================

Panel A: Threshold vs Peak Intensity by Channel
  - Green circles: HTT1a probe (488 nm excitation)
  - Orange squares: Full-length mHTT probe (548 nm excitation)
  - Dashed line: x = y reference (perfect correlation would follow this line)
  - Both channels show strong positive correlation

Panel B: Threshold vs Peak Intensity by Session
  - Colors indicate imaging session (blue = Session 1, red = Session 2, purple = Session 3)
  - Marker shapes indicate channel (circles = HTT1a, squares = fl-HTT)
  - Sessions cluster together, reflecting session-specific imaging conditions
  - Within-session variation is smaller than between-session variation

====================================================================================================
METHODOLOGY
====================================================================================================

Threshold calculation:
  - Quantile: 95th percentile of negative control spot intensities
  - Negative control: Bacterial DapB probe (not expressed in mammalian tissue)

Peak intensity calculation:
  - Method: Mode of kernel density estimate (KDE) of spot intensities
  - Only spots above threshold are included
  - Represents the most probable intensity for a single mRNA molecule
