SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURE: Effect of Threshold Calibration Method on Total mRNA Quantification
====================================================================================================

OVERVIEW
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This figure evaluates whether per-slide negative control calibration is necessary for accurate
mRNA quantification, or whether per-session (pooled) thresholds provide equivalent results.
We compare Total mRNA per nucleus calculated using two threshold approaches:
  1. SLIDE-SPECIFIC thresholds: 95th percentile of negative control intensities per slide
  2. SESSION-MEAN thresholds: Average of slide-specific thresholds within each imaging session

The analysis addresses a practical question: Can researchers simplify their calibration protocol
by using a single threshold per imaging session, rather than requiring negative control sections
on every experimental slide?

QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT
====================================================================================================

DATASET:
  - Total FOVs analyzed: 2,668
  - Imaging sessions: 3 (Session 1: n=634, Session 2: n=1072, Session 3: n=962)
  - Brain regions: Cortex (n=1394), Striatum (n=1274)
  - Channels: HTT1a (n=1334), fl-HTT (n=1334)

QUALITY CONTROL EXCLUSIONS:
  - Excluded slides (n=14): m1a1, m1a2, m1b2, m1b3, m1b4, m1b5, m2a1, m2a7, m2b2, m2b4, m2b5, m2b5, m3b4, m3b5
  - Reason for exclusion: Poor UBC positive control expression (100-1000x below normal),
    indicating technical failures such as poor hybridization, tissue damage, or imaging issues
  - Cluster CV filter: CV >= 0.5 (excludes clusters with low intensity variance)

AGREEMENT BETWEEN METHODS:
  - Pearson correlation: r = 0.9700 (p < 1e-100)
    → Near-perfect linear agreement between methods

  - Mean % difference (session-mean - slide-specific): -0.11% ± 23.73%
  - Median % difference: -2.66% (IQR: 28.60%)
    → Small systematic bias toward slightly lower values with session-mean thresholds

  - Paired t-test: t = 5.639, p = 1.89e-08
    → Statistically significant difference (due to large sample size)
  - Cohen's d effect size: -0.005
    → Negligible effect size

BLAND-ALTMAN ANALYSIS (Panel H):
  - Mean difference: -0.542 mRNA/nucleus
  - 95% Limits of agreement: [-10.27, 9.19] mRNA/nucleus
    → Most FOVs fall within ±9.7 mRNA/nucleus of each other

DISTRIBUTION OF DIFFERENCES:
  - FOVs with >10% difference: 67.1%
  - FOVs with >20% difference: 35.4%
  - FOVs with >50% difference: 5.2%

EXTREME VALUES (IMPORTANT!):
  - Maximum individual FOV difference: 94.1%
  - Range of differences: -65.6% to +94.1%
  - 5th to 95th percentile range: -34.8% to +46.2%
  - NOTE: While the MEAN difference is small, individual FOVs can differ by up to 60% or more!
    This variability is substantial and may affect biological conclusions for individual samples.

PER-SESSION BREAKDOWN:
  - Session 1: +3.53% ± 17.10% (n=634)
  - Session 2: -4.41% ± 19.61% (n=1072)
  - Session 3: +2.29% ± 30.10% (n=962)

PER-SLIDE VARIABILITY (Panel G):
  - Number of slides: 15
  - Maximum per-slide bias: 48.0% (slide: m3a3)
  - Slides with >10% mean bias: 10 (66.7%)
  - Slides with >20% mean bias: 6 (40.0%)

====================================================================================================
INTERPRETATION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
====================================================================================================

IS SLIDE-SPECIFIC CALIBRATION NECESSARY?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ANSWER: YES - SLIDE-SPECIFIC CALIBRATION IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED

Despite the small mean difference (-0.1%), individual FOVs show LARGE variability:
  - 35.4% of FOVs differ by >20%
  - Maximum difference observed: 94.1%
  - This means some individual measurements could be off by more than half!

STATISTICAL EVIDENCE:
  1. CORRELATION: r = 0.970 indicates near-perfect linear agreement.
     Both methods rank FOVs identically; relative comparisons are unaffected.

  2. SYSTEMATIC BIAS: Mean difference of -0.11% is negligible.
     This bias is unlikely to affect biological conclusions.

  3. INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY: 35.4% of FOVs differ by >20%.
     A substantial minority of measurements show large differences.

  4. PER-SLIDE EFFECTS: 6 of 15 slides (40.0%) show >20% mean bias.
     Some slides show substantial systematic differences between methods.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE USERS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. FOR HIGHEST ACCURACY (Recommended for publication-quality data):
   → Use SLIDE-SPECIFIC thresholds from per-slide negative control sections
   → This eliminates any potential slide-to-slide calibration artifacts
   → Required effort: One negative control section per experimental slide

2. FOR PRACTICAL EFFICIENCY (Acceptable for screening or exploratory work):
   → Use SESSION-MEAN thresholds (one negative control per imaging session)
   → Expected accuracy: r = 0.970 correlation with slide-specific values
   → Expected bias: -0.11% ± 23.73% systematic difference
   → Required effort: One negative control section per imaging session

3. CRITICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
   → Session 2 shows the largest systematic bias (-4.4%)
   → If comparing samples ACROSS sessions, slide-specific calibration is strongly recommended
   → If comparing samples WITHIN a single session, session-mean thresholds are acceptable

4. STUDY DESIGN IMPLICATIONS:
   → Ensure experimental groups are balanced across imaging sessions
   → If using session-mean thresholds, verify that biological groups are not confounded with sessions
   → Report which calibration method was used in methods section

METHODOLOGY
====================================================================================================

THRESHOLD CALCULATION:
  - Quantile: 95th percentile of negative control spot intensities
  - Negative control: Bacterial DapB probe (not expressed in mammalian tissue)
  - Slide-specific: Calculated independently for each slide-channel combination
  - Session-mean: Average of slide-specific thresholds within each imaging session
    (computed ONLY from included slides, excluding problematic slides listed above)

TOTAL mRNA PER NUCLEUS CALCULATION:
  Formula: Total mRNA per nucleus = (N_spots + I_clusters / I_peak) / N_nuclei

  Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. COUNT SINGLE SPOTS (N_spots):
     - Filter spots by intensity > threshold (from negative control)
     - Filter spots by detection quality (PFA < 0.05)
     - Count remaining spots as single mRNA molecules

  2. QUANTIFY CLUSTERED mRNA (I_clusters / I_peak):
     - I_clusters = Sum of integrated intensities from all clusters
     - Clusters must pass: intensity > threshold AND CV >= 0.5
     - I_peak = Mode of spot intensity distribution (from KDE)
     - I_peak represents the intensity of a single mRNA molecule
     - Division converts total cluster intensity to mRNA equivalents

  3. ESTIMATE NUCLEI COUNT (N_nuclei):
     - Segment DAPI channel to identify nuclear regions
     - Calculate total DAPI volume: V_DAPI = sum(label_sizes) × voxel_size
     - Estimate nuclei: N_nuclei = V_DAPI / mean_nuclear_volume
     - Mean nuclear volume = 716.0 µm³ (from literature)

  4. NORMALIZE TO PER-NUCLEUS:
     - Divide total mRNA (spots + cluster equivalents) by N_nuclei
     - Result: mRNA molecules per nucleus

  KEY INSIGHT: The threshold affects BOTH N_spots AND I_peak:
  - Higher threshold → fewer spots pass → lower N_spots
  - Higher threshold → higher I_peak (excludes low-intensity spots from KDE)
  - These effects partially cancel, but not perfectly

PERCENTAGE DIFFERENCE CALCULATION:
  Formula: % Difference = (mRNA_session − mRNA_slide) / mRNA_slide × 100

  Where:
    mRNA_session = Total mRNA/nucleus using session-mean threshold
    mRNA_slide = Total mRNA/nucleus using slide-specific threshold

  Interpretation:
    - Positive % → session-mean threshold gives HIGHER mRNA estimate
    - Negative % → session-mean threshold gives LOWER mRNA estimate
    - 0% → both methods give identical results

  Example: If slide-specific gives 50 mRNA/nucleus and session-mean gives 55:
    % Difference = (55 − 50) / 50 × 100 = +10%

CLUSTER QUALITY FILTERING:
  - Coefficient of Variation (CV) threshold: >= 0.5
  - Rationale: Clusters with low CV may represent uniform background or artifacts
  - True mRNA clusters show intensity heterogeneity due to multiple overlapping molecules

STATISTICAL TESTS:
  - Pearson correlation: Linear agreement between methods
  - Paired t-test: Systematic difference between methods
  - Cohen's d: Standardized effect size
  - Bland-Altman: Agreement analysis with limits of agreement
