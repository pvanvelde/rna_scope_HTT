Figure: Negative controls establish per-slide detection thresholds
======================================================================

Analysis of 727,329 negative control spots (bacterial DapB probe,
absent in mammalian tissue) across 30 slides (mean ± standard deviation:
24244 ± 7748 spots/slide;
13546 ± 7748 green, 10698 ± 6113 orange).

(A) Distributions of integrated photon counts from all negative-control detections
    (combined across slides). Mean ± s.d. of 95th percentile thresholds:
    - Green: 33277 ± 13186 photons
    - Orange: 12409 ± 5194 photons

(B) Cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) per slide (thin lines) and mean CDF
    across all slides (bold) demonstrate consistent tail behavior despite variation
    in median background. Horizontal line at 0.95 marks the quantile used for
    thresholding.

(C) Threshold values versus slide number (circles: green channel, squares: orange
    channel) reveal substantial slide-to-slide variation:
    - Coefficient of variation CV_green = 39.6%
      (33277 ± 13186 photons)
    - Coefficient of variation CV_orange = 41.9%
      (12409 ± 5194 photons)
    This motivates per-slide normalization to account for batch-to-batch variation
    in autofluorescence and staining efficiency.

All values reported as mean ± standard deviation across slides.
