Figure: Comprehensive Positive Control Analysis

This figure presents a detailed analysis of housekeeping gene expression (POLR2A and UBC)
in positive control samples from Q111 and Wildtype mice, demonstrating the validity of the
RNAscope quantification pipeline and the expected differential expression between low-
and high-expression housekeeping genes.

DATA FILTERING AND QUALITY CONTROL:
- Dataset: Positive control samples from Q111 and Wildtype mice
- Excluded slides (n=14): m1a1, m1a2, m1b2, m1b3, m1b4, m1b5, m2a1, m2a7, m2b2, m2b4, m2b5, m2b5, m3b4, m3b5
  (Slides excluded due to poor UBC positive control expression indicating technical failures)
- CV threshold for cluster filtering: CV >= 0.5
- Minimum nuclei per FOV: 40.0
- Intensity threshold: Per-slide, determined from negative control at quantile=0.95, max PFA=0.05

- Age range: 2 - 12 months
- Brain atlas coordinate range: 40.00 - 68.00 mm

VOXEL AND PIXEL PARAMETERS:
- Pixel size (XY): 162.5 nm
- Slice depth (Z): 500 nm
- Voxel size: 0.013203125000000001 $\mu$m$^3$
- Mean nuclear volume (for nuclei estimation): 716 $\mu$m$^3$

EXPRESSION STATISTICS:

POLR2A (low-expression housekeeping gene, green channel):
- Cortex: 15.68 ± 14.85 mRNA/cell (n=16 slides)
- Striatum: 17.39 ± 19.63 mRNA/cell (n=16 slides)
- Regional comparison (paired t-test): t=-0.922, p=0.371

UBC (high-expression housekeeping gene, orange channel):
- Cortex: 89.02 ± 46.96 mRNA/cell (n=16 slides)
- Striatum: 176.78 ± 103.34 mRNA/cell (n=16 slides)
- Regional comparison (paired t-test): t=-4.829, p=0.000221

UBC/POLR2A RATIO:
- Mean: 32.52 ± 54.87
- Median: 14.38
- Expected ratio based on known expression levels: ~10-20x

Row 4 - Expression Distributions:
J. Expression distributions by gene (POLR2A vs UBC)
K. Expression distributions by region (Cortex vs Striatum)
L. UBC/POLR2A ratio distribution with mean and median indicated

INTERPRETATION:
- UBC (high-expression housekeeping gene) shows ~10x higher expression than POLR2A (low-expression)
- This ratio is consistent with known expression levels from RNA-seq data
- Regional differences may reflect cell-type composition variations between Cortex and Striatum
- Age and atlas coordinate dependencies help identify potential confounders
- Non-significant correlations with age/atlas suggest robust normalization

METHODOLOGY:
- Peak intensity normalization: Slide-specific KDE mode estimation from single spots
- Total mRNA per cell: (N\_spots + I\_cluster\_total / I\_single\_peak) / N\_nuclei
- Cluster filtering: Intensity > threshold AND CV >= CV\_THRESHOLD
- Statistical tests: Paired t-tests for regional comparisons, Pearson correlation for continuous variables
