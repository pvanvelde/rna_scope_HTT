FIGURE: Comprehensive Negative Control Background Threshold Analysis
====================================================================================================

OVERVIEW
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This figure provides a comprehensive analysis of negative control background thresholds
across brain regions (Cortex vs Striatum), examining regional differences and their
relationships with age, sample size, and brain atlas coordinates. Negative control
thresholds define the intensity cutoff above which spots are considered true mRNA
signals rather than non-specific background.

BIOLOGICAL RATIONALE:
- Negative controls use bacterial DapB probes not expressed in mammalian tissue
- Any detected signal represents non-specific binding or autofluorescence
- The 95th percentile of negative control intensities provides a conservative threshold
- Regional differences may reflect tissue autofluorescence or composition

====================================================================================================
BIOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION
====================================================================================================

KEY FINDINGS:
  1. NO significant regional difference (p = 0.1969)
     -> Cortex and Striatum have similar background levels
  2. NO significant age effect on regional difference
     -> Age does not confound regional comparisons
  3. SIGNIFICANT rostrocaudal gradient in regional difference (r = -0.321)
     -> Regional threshold difference varies along anterior-posterior axis

PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR mRNA QUANTIFICATION:
  - Use region-specific thresholds when regional difference is significant
  - Per-slide calibration accounts for slide-to-slide technical variation
  - Green channel (488 nm) typically requires higher thresholds due to autofluorescence
  - Sample size > 100 spots provides stable threshold estimates

====================================================================================================
METHODOLOGY
====================================================================================================

THRESHOLD DETERMINATION:
  1. Collect all spot intensities from negative control (DapB) regions
  2. Apply quality filter: PFA < 0.05 (probability of false alarm)
  3. Compute 95th percentile as threshold
  4. Bootstrap 20 times to estimate uncertainty

STATISTICAL TESTS:
  - Paired t-test: Compare Cortex vs Striatum thresholds within same slides
  - Pearson correlation: Test linear relationships with continuous variables
  - Linear regression: Quantify slopes and significance of trends
