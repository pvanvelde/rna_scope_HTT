============================================================
JUSTIFICATION:
============================================================

These slides show abnormally low UBC expression in BOTH Cortex and Striatum.
UBC is a high-expression housekeeping gene that should show consistent strong signal.
Such extreme low values (100-1000× below normal) indicate technical failures:
  • Poor probe hybridization
  • Tissue damage or degradation
  • Processing artifacts
  • Incomplete tissue coverage in imaging FOV

Including these slides would:
  1. Artificially inflate variance in expression measurements
  2. Bias mean expression estimates downward
  3. Obscure true biological signal
  4. Compromise statistical power

RECOMMENDATION: Exclude these slides from all downstream analyses.
