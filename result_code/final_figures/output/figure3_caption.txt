Figure 3: Regional expression patterns and total mRNA quantification in Q111 and WT mice.

OVERVIEW:
This figure presents a comprehensive analysis of mRNA expression patterns across brain regions, age groups, anatomical coordinates, and individual animals. The analysis compares Q111 Huntington's disease transgenic mice with wildtype (WT) controls, examining both mHTT1a (mutant huntingtin exon 1, detected in green channel) and full-length mHTT (complete mutant huntingtin transcript, detected in orange channel) probes. The data reveal regional heterogeneity in expression levels and demonstrate reproducibility across biological replicates.

PANEL DESCRIPTIONS:

(A) ANATOMICAL OVERVIEW AND SUBREGION LABELS
Representative images showing the brain regions analyzed in this study.
- Left half-brain: Striatum highlighted in red, identified using DARPP-32 RNA probe as a cell-type marker
- Yellow box: Zoomed region showing imaging FOV locations
- Right half-brain: Schematic showing all imaged subregions labeled with lowercase letters (a-i)

SUBREGION LABEL KEY (referenced in Panel B x-axis):
  Striatum (identified via DARPP-32 marker):
    a: dorsomedial striatum
    b: dorsolateral striatum
    c: ventrolateral striatum
    d: ventromedial striatum
  Cortex (approximate regions - no cell-type markers available):
    e: primary/secondary motor area (M1/M2)
    f: primary somatosensory area, upper limb (S1)
    g: primary somatosensory area, nose (S1)
    h: gustatory area / agranular insular area
    i: piriform area (olfactory cortex)

NOTE: Cortical region assignments are APPROXIMATE based on anatomical landmarks.
Without cell-type specific markers for cortex, these labels broadly indicate the
different cortical areas sampled to capture regional heterogeneity, but are not
definitive cell-type identifications.

(D) TOTAL mRNA EXPRESSION BY AGE (per-slide aggregation)
Age-dependent expression analysis comparing Q111 transgenic and WT control mice.
- DATA AGGREGATION: To avoid pseudoreplication, FOVs are first averaged within each slide.
  Each bar shows mean ± SEM across slides (n = number of slides, not FOVs).
  See sample size table below for n per condition.

  * Q111 vs WT comparison reveals disease-associated expression differences
  * Region-specific patterns (Cortex vs Striatum) may indicate differential vulnerability

(E) TOTAL mRNA EXPRESSION BY BRAIN ATLAS COORDINATE, GROUPED BY AGE (all FOVs merged)
Anterior-posterior expression gradient analysis organized by age brackets (2mo, 6mo, 12mo).
- DATA AGGREGATION: All FOVs per atlas coordinate are merged together (not per-slide).
  Each bar shows mean ± SEM across all FOVs at that coordinate.
  This provides maximum spatial resolution but n reflects FOV count, not biological replicates.
- X-axis: Brain atlas coordinate in 25 μm units from Bregma, grouped by age
  * Age brackets (bold labels at top): 2mo, 6mo, 12mo
  * Within each age bracket: Q111 coordinates (left), WT coordinates (right)

  * W (e.g., W38, W44): Wildtype mouse coordinates
- Y-axis: Total mRNA per nucleus
- Data visualization: Grouped bar plots showing mean ± SEM across FOVs
- Color and pattern coding: Same as panel D
- Separator lines:
  * Solid vertical lines: Separate age brackets
  * Dashed vertical lines: Separate Q111 from WT within each age bracket
- Interpretation:
  * Within-age comparisons: Q111 vs WT at each coordinate within the same age
  * Across-age comparisons: Same coordinates can be compared between age brackets
  * Anterior-posterior gradients visible within each age group
  * Age-related changes in expression gradient patterns may indicate disease progression

(F) PER-SLIDE BREAKDOWN, GROUPED BY AGE (individual slides shown)
Per-slide analysis organized by age brackets (2mo, 6mo, 12mo).
- DATA AGGREGATION: Each bar represents one slide. FOVs within each slide are averaged,
  and each slide is shown as a separate entry. Error bars show SEM across FOVs within that slide.
  This is the most granular view of biological variability at the slide level.
- X-axis: Individual slide identifiers, grouped by age
  * Age brackets (bold labels at top): 2mo, 6mo, 12mo
  * Within each age bracket: Q111 slides (left), WT slides (right)
  * Q#1.1, Q#1.2: Slide-level labels within each mouse (mouse.slide notation)
  * W#1.1, W#1.2: Same notation for WT mice
- Y-axis: Total mRNA per nucleus
- Data visualization: Grouped bar plots showing mean ± SEM per slide (across FOVs within slide)
- Each entry has 4 bars: mHTT1a Cortex, mHTT1a Striatum, full-length Cortex, full-length Striatum
- Color and pattern coding: Same as panels D and E
- Separator lines:
  * Solid vertical lines: Separate age brackets
  * Dashed vertical lines: Separate Q111 from WT within each age bracket

FILTERING APPLIED (consistent with Figure 1, panels E onwards)
================================================================================

FOV-LEVEL ANALYSIS:
This figure analyzes mRNA expression at the FOV (field-of-view) level, aggregating cluster intensities per FOV and normalizing by nucleus count.

UPSTREAM SPOT FILTERING (applied before cluster identification):
1. DETECTION QUALITY FILTER (PFA):
   - Criterion: Probability of False Alarm < 0.05
   - Purpose: Remove spots with poor Gaussian fit quality

2. INTENSITY THRESHOLD (from negative controls):
   - Criterion: Integrated photons > 95th percentile of negative control distribution
   - Purpose: Remove background/noise spots below detection threshold
   - Threshold: Calculated per slide-channel combination

3. SIZE LOWER BOUND (from bead PSF):
   - Criterion: σ_x ≥ 148.0 nm (80% × bead PSF of 185.0 nm)
   - Purpose: Remove artifactually small spots (noise, fitting errors)

CLUSTER IDENTIFICATION:
- Method: 3D connected component analysis on intensity-thresholded images
- Cluster intensity: Sum of all voxel intensities, normalized to mRNA equivalents

4. CLUSTER INTENSITY THRESHOLD (from negative controls):
   - Criterion: Cluster total intensity > 95th percentile of negative control distribution
   - Purpose: Remove clusters with intensity below the noise floor (false positive clusters)
   - Threshold: Calculated per slide-channel combination (same threshold as spot filter)

5. CLUSTER CV (COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION) THRESHOLD:
   - Criterion: Cluster CV >= 0.5 (CV = standard deviation / mean of voxel intensities)
   - Purpose: Remove clusters with low intensity heterogeneity (likely noise or artifacts)
   - Rationale: True mRNA aggregates show spatial variation in signal; uniform low-variance regions are noise
   - See Figure 2 caption for detailed cluster discard statistics

FOV-LEVEL AGGREGATION:
- Total mRNA per FOV: Sum of all cluster intensities in the FOV
- mRNA per nucleus: (Total mRNA per FOV) / (Number of DAPI-positive nuclei)
- Minimum nuclei threshold: FOVs with < 40 nuclei are excluded

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- FOV = Field of View (single microscopy image)
- mRNA/nucleus calculated as: (total mRNA in FOV) / (number of DAPI-positive nuclei in FOV)
- Bead PSF: σ_x = 185.0 nm, σ_y = 187.0 nm, σ_z = 573.0 nm
- Size lower bound: σ ≥ 80% of bead PSF (148.0 nm for σ_x)
- Excluded slides: ['m1a2', 'm1b5', 'm2b5', 'm2b2', 'm2a7', 'm2a1', 'm2b4', 'm2b5', 'm3b4', 'm1a1', 'm1b2', 'm1b3', 'm1b4', 'm3b5'] (technical failures - imaging artifacts or tissue damage)
- SEM calculation: standard deviation / sqrt(n) where n = number of FOVs per condition
- Broken y-axis used when outlier values would compress the main distribution visualization
- Atlas coordinates reference: Franklin & Paxinos Mouse Brain Atlas, 3rd edition

COLOR SCHEME SUMMARY:
| Probe | Q111 Color | WT Color |
|-------|------------|----------|
| mHTT1a (exon 1) | Green (#2ecc71) | Blue (#3498db) |
| Full-length mHTT | Orange (#f39c12) | Purple (#9b59b6) |

================================================================================
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Statistical tests were performed to assess three biological questions:
1. Does expression differ between brain regions (Cortex vs Striatum)?
2. Does expression change with age?
3. Is there a genotype effect (Q111 vs WT)?

METHODS:
- Data aggregation: To avoid pseudoreplication, FOV-level measurements were first
  averaged within each slide. Each slide is treated as an independent observation
  unit, and n reported in the tables below refers to the number of slides, not FOVs.
  This is important because multiple FOVs from the same slide are not truly
  independent observations.
- Region comparisons: Mann-Whitney U test (two-sided, non-parametric) comparing Cortex vs Striatum
- Age comparisons: Pairwise Mann-Whitney U tests between consecutive age groups (2mo vs 6mo, 6mo vs 12mo)
- Genotype comparisons: Mann-Whitney U test (two-sided, non-parametric) comparing Q111 vs WT
- Significance levels: * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001, ns = not significant

IMPORTANT NOTE ON SAMPLE SIZES:
- Q111 mice: n=4-6 slides per condition - sufficient for exploratory analysis but limited statistical power
- WT mice: n=1-2 slides per condition - TOO SMALL to draw meaningful statistical conclusions
  The WT data is included for descriptive comparison only. Any WT comparisons (region, age, or
  genotype) should be interpreted with extreme caution due to inadequate sample sizes. Additional
  WT samples would be needed to validate any observed differences.

+----------+------------------+------+-------------------+--------------------+--------+---------+------+

Key finding: With per-slide aggregation (n=4-6 slides per group), no significant regional differences were detected, likely due to limited statistical power with small sample sizes.

Key finding: With per-slide aggregation (n=4-6 Q111 slides, n=1-2 WT slides), no significant genotype differences were detected due to limited statistical power. However, Q111 consistently showed higher expression than WT (e.g., mHTT1a in striatum at 12mo: 5.2-fold difference, 25.7 vs 4.9 mRNA/nucleus).

Note: Statistical tests using per-slide aggregation did not reach significance due to limited
sample sizes (n=4-6 slides per Q111 group, n=1-2 for WT). The observations below describe
trends visible in the data that would require larger sample sizes to confirm statistically.

1. REGIONAL PATTERNS: mHTT1a median expression tends to be higher in striatum than cortex
   in Q111 mice at later ages (6-12mo), while full-length mHTT shows similar levels in both regions
2. AGE-RELATED TRENDS: Both probes show increasing median expression with age across conditions,
   consistent with progressive mRNA accumulation during disease progression
3. GENOTYPE DIFFERENCES: Q111 median expression values are consistently higher than WT
   (e.g., 5.2-fold for mHTT1a in striatum at 12mo), but statistical power is insufficient to confirm
4. PROBE-SPECIFIC PATTERNS: mHTT1a and full-length mHTT show different regional patterns in Q111
5. BIOLOGICAL REPRODUCIBILITY: Per-mouse analysis (Panel F) shows consistent patterns across slides
6. ANATOMICAL GRADIENTS: Atlas coordinate analysis (Panel E) reveals anterior-posterior variation
