Figure 4: FOV-level variance and extreme outlier analysis reveals heterogeneous mRNA accumulation in Q111 mice.

OVERVIEW:
This figure presents a comprehensive analysis of field-of-view (FOV) level heterogeneity in mRNA expression, with a focus on identifying "extreme" FOVs that exceed normal variation. The analysis defines extreme FOVs as those exceeding the 95th percentile of the wildtype distribution, providing a biologically-grounded threshold that accounts for natural variation in healthy tissue. The results reveal that Q111 transgenic mice have a significantly higher proportion of extreme FOVs compared to wildtype controls, indicating disease-associated mRNA accumulation hotspots.

EXTREME FOV DEFINITION:
"Extreme" FOVs are defined as those with clustered mRNA per nucleus EXCEEDING the 95th percentile of the wildtype distribution. This threshold is calculated SEPARATELY for each of 4 channel-region combinations:
1. mHTT1a + Cortex → threshold = 12.80 mRNA/nucleus
2. mHTT1a + Striatum → threshold = 7.76 mRNA/nucleus
3. Full-length mHTT + Cortex → threshold = 38.43 mRNA/nucleus
4. Full-length mHTT + Striatum → threshold = 20.57 mRNA/nucleus

This approach ensures that:
- The threshold is biologically meaningful (based on healthy tissue variation)
- Region-specific differences in baseline expression are accounted for
- Channel-specific detection efficiencies are normalized
- By definition, ~5% of WT FOVs will be "extreme" (sampling variability causes deviation from exactly 5%)

EXTREME FOV STATISTICS (Q111 vs expected 5%):
- mHTT1a Cortex: 215 extreme / 697 total = 30.8%
- mHTT1a Striatum: 395 extreme / 637 total = 62.0%
- Full-length Cortex: 112 extreme / 697 total = 16.1%
- Full-length Striatum: 277 extreme / 637 total = 43.5%

FOV-LEVEL ANALYSIS:
This figure analyzes mRNA expression at the FOV (field-of-view) level, comparing Q111 vs WT distributions and identifying "extreme" FOVs.

UPSTREAM SPOT FILTERING (applied before cluster identification):
1. DETECTION QUALITY FILTER (PFA):
   - Criterion: Probability of False Alarm < 0.05
   - Purpose: Remove spots with poor Gaussian fit quality

2. INTENSITY THRESHOLD (from negative controls):
   - Criterion: Integrated photons > 95th percentile of negative control distribution
   - Purpose: Remove background/noise spots below detection threshold
   - Threshold: Calculated per slide-channel combination

3. SIZE LOWER BOUND (from bead PSF):
   - Criterion: σ_x ≥ 148.0 nm (80% × bead PSF of 185.0 nm)
   - Purpose: Remove artifactually small spots (noise, fitting errors)

CLUSTER IDENTIFICATION:
- Method: 3D connected component analysis on intensity-thresholded images
- Cluster intensity: Sum of all voxel intensities, normalized to mRNA equivalents

4. CLUSTER INTENSITY THRESHOLD (from negative controls):
   - Criterion: Cluster total intensity > 95th percentile of negative control distribution
   - Purpose: Remove clusters with intensity below the noise floor (false positive clusters)
   - Threshold: Calculated per slide-channel combination (same threshold as spot filter)

5. CLUSTER CV (COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION) THRESHOLD:
   - Criterion: Cluster CV >= 0.5 (CV = standard deviation / mean of voxel intensities)
   - Purpose: Remove clusters with low intensity heterogeneity (likely noise or artifacts)
   - Rationale: True mRNA aggregates show spatial variation in signal; uniform low-variance regions are noise
   - See Figure 2 caption for detailed cluster discard statistics

FOV-LEVEL AGGREGATION:
- Clustered mRNA per nucleus: (Sum of cluster intensities) / (Number of DAPI-positive nuclei)
- Minimum nuclei threshold: FOVs with < 40 nuclei are excluded

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- Bead PSF: σ_x = 185.0 nm, σ_y = 187.0 nm, σ_z = 573.0 nm
- Size lower bound: σ ≥ 80% of bead PSF (148.0 nm for σ_x)
- Excluded slides: ['m1a2', 'm1b5', 'm2b5', 'm2b2', 'm2a7', 'm2a1', 'm2b4', 'm2b5', 'm3b4', 'm1a1', 'm1b2', 'm1b3', 'm1b4', 'm3b5'] (technical failures - imaging artifacts or tissue damage)
- Statistical test: Mann-Whitney U test (non-parametric, two-sided)
- Histogram tail compression: Values > cutoff aggregated into single ">X" bin to improve visualization

COLOR SCHEME SUMMARY:
| Condition | mHTT1a | Full-length mHTT |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Q111 | Green (#2ecc71) | Orange (#f39c12) |

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Q111 MICE HAVE ELEVATED EXTREME FOV PERCENTAGE: Across all channel-region combinations, Q111 mice show significantly higher proportion of extreme FOVs compared to the expected 5% from WT controls
2. REGIONAL DIFFERENCES: Striatum shows higher extreme FOV percentages than Cortex, consistent with striatal vulnerability in Huntington's disease
3. AGE-DEPENDENT PROGRESSION: Extreme FOV percentage tends to increase with age, suggesting progressive mRNA accumulation
4. INTER-INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY: Some Q111 mice show substantially higher extreme FOV percentages, indicating biological heterogeneity in disease severity
5. ANATOMICAL HOTSPOTS: Certain atlas coordinates show elevated extreme FOV prevalence, potentially indicating regionally-selective vulnerability
6. PROBE CONSISTENCY: Both mHTT1a and full-length probes show similar patterns, validating the biological relevance of the findings
