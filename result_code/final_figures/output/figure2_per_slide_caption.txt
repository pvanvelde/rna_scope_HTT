Supplementary Figure: Per-Slide Analysis of Volume-Intensity Scaling and Normalization Validation

================================================================================
OVERVIEW
================================================================================

This figure examines the consistency of the volume-intensity scaling relationship across individual slides
and evaluates whether the per-slide normalization procedure introduces systematic biases. The analysis
addresses two key questions: (1) How variable is the mRNA density (slope) across slides? (2) Is the
observed variability related to the normalization reference (peak intensity)?

NORMALIZATION METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

PEAK INTENSITY AS THE SINGLE-MOLECULE REFERENCE (N_{1mRNA}):
The peak intensity represents the modal (most frequent) intensity of single-molecule spots and serves
as our operational definition of "1 mRNA equivalent." This normalization is critical because:

1. PHYSICAL BASIS: The peak of the single-molecule intensity distribution corresponds to individual
   mRNA molecules detected by the RNAscope probe set (~20 fluorescent labels per target mRNA).

2. PER-SLIDE CALIBRATION: Each slide has its own peak intensity value due to:
   - Variation in imaging conditions (laser power, detector sensitivity)
   - Tissue-specific autofluorescence
   - Hybridization efficiency differences
   - Optical path variations

3. NORMALIZATION PROCEDURE:
   - For each slide, identify single-molecule spots (σ_z within 458-701 nm range)
   - Compute kernel density estimation (KDE) of spot intensities
   - Peak intensity = mode of the KDE (intensity with highest probability density)
   - All cluster intensities are divided by this peak to obtain mRNA equivalents

4. INTERPRETATION:
   - Cluster intensity of 1.0 = intensity equivalent to one mRNA molecule
   - Cluster intensity of 10.0 = intensity equivalent to ~10 mRNA molecules
   - The slope (β) represents mRNA density: mRNA equivalents per cubic micrometer

STATISTICAL METHODS
================================================================================

PER-SLIDE BINNING:
- Volume range: 0-30 μm³ (consistent with main Figure 2)
- Number of bins: 20 equally-spaced bins
- Minimum clusters per bin for display: 5
- Binned statistic: Mean intensity within each volume bin

LINEAR REGRESSION (per slide):
- Method: Ordinary least squares (numpy.polyfit, degree=1)
- Dependent variable: Normalized intensity (mRNA equivalents)
- Independent variable: Cluster volume (μm³)
- Slope interpretation: mRNA density within clusters

GOODNESS OF FIT:
- R² = 1 - (SS_residual / SS_total)
- Computed on individual cluster data points (not binned means)

CORRELATION ANALYSIS (Panels C, D):
- Method: Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient
- Tests whether slopes are systematically related to normalization values
- Null hypothesis: No linear relationship between peak intensity and slope (r = 0)
- Two-tailed p-value from t-distribution with n-2 degrees of freedom

INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

1. SLOPE VARIABILITY IS WITHIN EXPECTED BIOLOGICAL RANGE:
   - Green channel CV = 36.3%, Orange channel CV = 26.3%
   - This ~25-35% variability is typical for biological measurements across independent tissue samples
   - All slopes are positive and within a reasonable range, confirming the linear relationship holds

2. NORMALIZATION DOES NOT DRIVE SLOPE VARIABILITY:
   - Green channel: r = -0.37, p = 0.17 (not significant)
   - Orange channel: r = 0.04, p = 0.89 (not significant)
   - The weak/non-significant correlations indicate that per-slide peak intensity estimation
     does not systematically bias the slope measurements
   - This validates our normalization approach

3. HIGH WITHIN-SLIDE CONSISTENCY:
   - Mean R² values (0.78 green, 0.81 orange) indicate strong
     linear relationships within each slide
   - The linear volume-intensity model is appropriate for the data

4. BIOLOGICAL SOURCES OF VARIABILITY:
   The observed inter-slide variability likely reflects genuine biological differences:
   - Different animals may have different mRNA packing densities in aggregates
   - Tissue section quality varies (depth, fixation, processing)
   - Regional heterogeneity within the tissue
   - Disease progression state may vary between animals

5. VALIDATION OF QUANTIFICATION METHODOLOGY:
   The consistency of positive slopes across all slides, combined with the lack of
   normalization-induced bias, supports the validity of our mRNA quantification approach.
   The per-slide normalization successfully removes technical variation while preserving
   biological signal.
