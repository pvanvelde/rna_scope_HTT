Figure 1: Establishing detection thresholds and single-molecule criteria through multi-stage calibration.

OVERVIEW:
This figure presents the complete calibration pipeline for RNAscope single-molecule FISH quantification. The workflow establishes: (1) intensity thresholds from negative controls, (2) per-slide normalization using single-molecule reference intensities, and (3) size-based filtering to distinguish true single molecules from unresolved aggregates. The pipeline is validated on bead calibration data before application to experimental tissue sections.

(C) NEGATIVE CONTROL THRESHOLD DETERMINATION
Cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of integrated photon counts from negative control sections using bacterial DapB probe (a gene not expressed in mammalian tissue).
- Total spots analyzed: n = 727,329 across 30 independent slides (ALL slides included for calibration)
- Each faint line represents an individual slide's CDF (showing inter-slide variability)
- Bold lines indicate channel-specific aggregate distributions (green = 488nm channel for mHTT1a probe; orange = 548nm channel for full-length mHTT probe)
- Red dashed horizontal line marks the 95th percentile threshold (quantile = 0.95)
- This threshold defines the minimum photon count required to distinguish true signal from background autofluorescence and non-specific binding
- The consistent tail behavior across slides validates that threshold determination is robust to imaging batch effects
- Threshold values are computed separately for each slide-channel combination to account for local imaging conditions
- FILTERING APPLIED: PFA filter only (probability of false alarm < 5e-02)

(E) NORMALIZED INTENSITY DISTRIBUTIONS (BEAD CALIBRATION DATA)
Per-slide intensity calibration demonstrating the normalization procedure.
- Data source: Bead calibration dataset, green channel only
- Total spots: n = 1,819,916 across 26 slides
- Main panel shows normalized intensity distributions where modal intensity is set to N_{1mRNA} = 1.0
- Normalization procedure: Kernel density estimation (KDE) with Scott's rule bandwidth is used to identify the modal (peak) intensity for each slide; all intensities are then divided by this peak value
- Red dashed vertical line at N/N_{1mRNA} = 1.0 marks the single-molecule reference intensity
- Inset panel (upper right) shows raw photon count distributions BEFORE normalization, demonstrating 2-3× slide-to-slide variation arising from:
  * Variable imaging conditions (laser power drift, detector sensitivity)
  * Tissue autofluorescence differences
  * Probe hybridization efficiency variation
  * Optical path differences between imaging sessions
- After normalization, all distributions collapse around N_{1mRNA} = 1.0, removing technical variation while preserving the biological tail (spots with intensity > 1 represent aggregates of multiple mRNA molecules)
- FILTERING APPLIED:
  1. PFA filter: probability of false alarm < 5e-02
  2. Intensity threshold: photons > slide-specific threshold (from negative control 95th percentile)

(F) BIPHASIC SIZE-INTENSITY RELATIONSHIP (BEAD CALIBRATION)
Empirical definition of the single-molecule regime using spot size measurements.
- Top panel (biphasic plot): Mean normalized intensity vs. lateral spot width (σ_x) showing characteristic biphasic relationship
  * Left region (σ_x < breakpoint): Linear positive slope where larger spots have higher intensity - this represents true single molecules where size variation arises from RNAscope probe cluster geometry (~20 probe pairs per target)
  * Right region (σ_x > breakpoint): Plateau/saturation where intensity no longer scales with size - this represents unresolved aggregates of multiple mRNA molecules that cannot be separated optically
  * Breakpoint location: 290.8 nm (determined by piecewise-linear regression)
  * Purple dotted line: Bead PSF width from fluorescent microsphere calibration = 185.0 nm
  * Breakpoint exceeds bead PSF by 57.2%, consistent with physical dimensions of RNAscope probe clusters
  * Shaded region: ±1 standard deviation across 26 slides, demonstrating reproducibility
- Bottom panel (size PDF): Probability density distribution of σ_x values
  * Aggregated distribution across all slides (black filled curve)
  * Individual slide distributions shown as colored lines
  * Mode of distribution defines the tissue-calibrated PSF that accounts for in situ optical conditions (differs from theoretical bead-derived PSF due to tissue scattering)
- X-AXIS RANGE: 100 nm to 500 nm (shared with panel I for comparison)
- FILTERING APPLIED:
  1. PFA filter: probability of false alarm < 5e-02
  2. Intensity threshold: photons > slide-specific threshold (from negative control 95th percentile)
  3. Size lower bound: σ_x ≥ 148.0 nm (80% of bead PSF = 0.8 × 185.0 nm)
     - Spots smaller than 80% of the bead PSF are likely noise/artifacts and are excluded

(H) NORMALIZED INTENSITY DISTRIBUTIONS (EXPERIMENTAL TISSUE)
Application of calibration pipeline to experimental Q111 transgenic mouse tissue.
- Data source: Experimental tissue sections from Q111 Huntington's disease mouse model
- Total spots analyzed: n = 249,526 across 26 slides (green channel, mHTT1a probe)
- Note: ALL slides included for calibration purposes; 13 slides are excluded in subsequent figures for quantification due to technical failures
- Same normalization procedure as panel E applied to tissue data
- Successful collapse of distributions around N_{1mRNA} = 1.0 confirms that the calibration pipeline generalizes from bead data to tissue
- Preserved tail region (N > 1) contains biologically relevant aggregate information
- FILTERING APPLIED (same as panels E-F):
  1. PFA filter: probability of false alarm < 5e-02
  2. Intensity threshold: photons > slide-specific threshold (from negative control 95th percentile)

(I) BIPHASIC SIZE-INTENSITY RELATIONSHIP (EXPERIMENTAL TISSUE)
Validation of single-molecule filtering criteria in experimental tissue.
- Same analysis as panel F applied to experimental tissue data
- Reproduction of biphasic relationship confirms that:
  * Size-based filtering (σ < breakpoint) successfully isolates single-molecule regime in tissue
  * The intensity-size relationship in the single-molecule regime is linear (validates quantification accuracy)
  * Breakpoint values are consistent between bead and tissue data
- Bead PSF reference values: σ_x = 185.0 nm, σ_y = 187.0 nm, σ_z = 573.0 nm
- Breakpoint values: σ_x = 290.8 nm, σ_y = 291.1 nm, σ_z = 698.6 nm
- X-AXIS RANGE: 100 nm to 500 nm (shared with panel F; data filtered to start at 148.0 nm)
- FILTERING APPLIED (same as panel F):
  1. PFA filter: probability of false alarm < 5e-02
  2. Intensity threshold: photons > slide-specific threshold (from negative control 95th percentile)
  3. Size lower bound: σ_x ≥ 148.0 nm (80% of bead PSF)

FILTERING PIPELINE SUMMARY (Applied consistently from Panel E onwards)
================================================================================

SINGLE SPOT FILTERING (3 sequential steps):
1. DETECTION QUALITY FILTER (PFA):
   - Criterion: Probability of False Alarm < 5e-02
   - Purpose: Remove spots with poor Gaussian fit quality
   - Applied: All panels

2. INTENSITY THRESHOLD (from negative controls):
   - Criterion: Integrated photons > 95th percentile of negative control distribution
   - Purpose: Remove background/noise spots below detection threshold
   - Threshold: Calculated per slide-channel combination
   - Applied: Panels E, F, H, I and all downstream figures

3. SIZE LOWER BOUND (from bead PSF):
   - Criterion: σ_x ≥ 148.0 nm (80% × bead PSF of 185.0 nm)
   - Purpose: Remove artifactually small spots (noise, fitting errors)
   - Rationale: True fluorescent spots cannot be smaller than the optical PSF
   - Applied: Panels F, I (biphasic plots) and all downstream figures

CLUSTER IDENTIFICATION (applied in subsequent figures):
- Definition: Connected components of spots within spatial proximity
- Single-molecule vs Aggregate classification:
  * Single molecules: σ_x < breakpoint (290.8 nm)
  * Aggregates/clusters: σ_x ≥ breakpoint OR multiple overlapping spots
- Cluster intensity: Sum of constituent spot intensities (in mRNA equivalents)

================================================================================
QUALITY CONTROL - SLIDE EXCLUSIONS (Applied in Subsequent Figures)
================================================================================
IMPORTANT: This figure (Figure 1) uses ALL slides for calibration purposes.
The following 13 slides are excluded ONLY in subsequent figures (Figure 2+) for mRNA quantification:
- Excluded slides: m1a1, m1a2, m1b2, m1b3, m1b4, m1b5, m2a1, m2a7, m2b2, m2b4, m2b5, m3b4, m3b5
- Reason for exclusion: Poor UBC positive control expression (100-1000x below normal) in both cortex and striatum,
  indicating technical failures such as poor hybridization, tissue damage, or imaging issues
- Exclusion identified through UBC positive control analysis (see Supplementary Figure: Positive Control QC)

Rationale for including all slides in Figure 1:
- Calibration parameters (PSF, breakpoints, thresholds) should be established on maximal data
- Technical failures affect mRNA quantification but not the underlying optical/detection parameters
- Including all slides provides more robust estimation of noise floor and threshold distributions

================================================================================
STATISTICAL SUMMARY
================================================================================
- Negative control threshold quantile: 95th percentile
- Maximum probability of false alarm: 5e-02
- Bead PSF width (σ_x from microsphere calibration): 185.0 nm
- Size lower bound (σ_x): 148.0 nm (80% of bead PSF)
- Single-molecule breakpoint (σ_x): 290.8 nm
- Breakpoint/PSF ratio: 1.57 (57.2% larger than bead PSF)

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================
1. Per-slide normalization effectively removes 2-3× technical variation in raw photon counts while preserving biological signal in the intensity tail
2. Breakpoints consistently exceed bead-derived PSF values by ~57%, which is consistent with RNAscope probe cluster physical dimensions (~20 probe pairs spanning ~40-60 nm)
3. The 80% PSF lower bound effectively removes artifactually small spots while retaining true single molecules
4. Strong linear intensity-size relationships in the single-molecule regime validate that size-filtered spots represent true single molecules suitable for quantification
5. The calibration pipeline generalizes from controlled bead measurements to complex tissue samples with high reproducibility
