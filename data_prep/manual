Steps:
1. Merge slide scanner images to image stacks: merge_slide_scanner_images.py
2. Potentially upload these to cluster
3. run main.py on this folder to get the results. Save as h5 file (potentially on cluster)





For training NN:
1. Run AnnotationTool.py to create subregions and save in folder
2. use labkit imagej to create label data. save data with _label suffix.
3. Run AnnotationTool.py to create subregions on controls, and create zero labels.
4. Run createh5filesfor training.py to create h5 files that can be used in training
5. Run training_model.py to train model
